#  Clima

The app allows to check the weather for the current location based on the GPS data from the iPhone as well as by searching for a city manually. 

## What have I used

* Dark-mode enabled app.
* Vector images as image assets.
* UITextField to get user input. 
* The delegate pattern.
* Swift protocols and extensions. 
* Swift guard keyword. 
* Swift computed properties.
* Swift closures and completion handlers.
* URLSession to network and make HTTP requests.
* Parse JSON with the native Encodable and Decodable protocols. 
* Usage of Grand Central Dispatch to fetch the main thread.
* Usage of Core Location to get the current location from the phone GPS.
